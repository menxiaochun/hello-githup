Scope

I recommend that you focus your scope on classification and regression type problems and the relevant algorithms and tools. These are the two most common underlying machine learning problems that most other problems can be reduced to.

There are subfields of Machine Learning such as Computer Vision, Natural Language Process, Recommender Systems or Reinforcement Learning. These areas can be reduced to classification and regression problems and their study does neatly fit into the roadmap structure that is presented. I would suggest not diving into these fields until you are at the intermediate level.

Principles

I have a few pragmatic principles that might help you make you make fast and useful progress towards your goals in machine learning. They really frame the roadmap.

Machine Learning is a journey. You need to know where you are now and where you are trying to get to. It’s going to take time and hard work, but there is plenty of help available to you.
Create semi-formal work products. Write down what you learn and discover along the way in the form of blog posts, technical reports, and code repositories. You will quickly amass a portfolio of demonstrated skill and knowledge for you and others to reflect on.
Just-in-time learning. Do not learn complex topics until just before you need them. For example, learn just enough probability or linear algebra to understand the algorithm you’re working on, do not take a 3 year course in stats and maths before you start machine learning.
Leverage existing skills. If you can code, implement algorithms to understand them rather than studying the math. Use languages you know. Focus on the one thing you are learning, don’t complicate it by learning a new language, tool or library at the same time.
Mastery is an ideal. Mastery of machine learning requires continuous learning. You can never actually reach it, you can only continue to study, learn and improve.
Tips

Below are 3 tips to effectively get the most out of this guide and your journey in machine learning:

Start with a small project that you can complete in one hour.
Aim to complete one project per week in order to build up and maintain your momentum and a workspace of projects that you can build upon.
Share your results on your blog, Facebook, Google+, Github or wherever you can to demonstrate your interest, increasing skills, knowledge and to get feedback.
